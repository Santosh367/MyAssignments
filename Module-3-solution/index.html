            <p id="text2" class="text-justify">It is often said that the best test of both the professional and the home cook is
              a roasted chicken, that, if nothing else, a good cook should always be able to serve up a beautiful
              bird—crispy, appetizingly fragrant, the skin deeply golden, with meat so moist that you’re tempted to
              tear it off the bone with your fingers. Roasted chicken is a Sunday lunch you can count on; or a bistro
              dinner, with hot fries and mayonnaise; or a don’t-think-twice homey meal, with potatoes and gravy, for
              friends who just showed up in town and want to come over this evening.
              In fact, it is almost impossible to get consistently right. The difficulty, of course, is that the
              chicken, like many birds, consists not of one type of meat but of two—one white, the other dark. White meat (the
              breast) likes to cook quickly; dark meat (the legs) needs long and slow. The former tastes of nothing if
              cooked too long; the latter is impossible to chew if cooked too fast. The simplest fix is to respect the
              science of the fowl’s anatomy—remove the breasts, snap off the thighs, and cook them separately. This
              approach is a no-brainer with other birds, especially duck, whose breast is exquisite when rare and
              whose legs are scrumptious beyond belief when simmered for several hours in barely bubbling fat, for duck
              confit (from the French verb confire, meaning to conserve: traditionally, the legs are stored in the fat
              they’re cooked in). But the whole, intact chicken, especially when roasted, has properties that you don’t want
              to lose by breaking it into bits: for instance, the three surprisingly satisfying segments of the wing,
              which you can eat with your fingers (you’d never bother with, say, the delicate little flappers of a tiny
              quail), or the wedge of yumminess surrounding the wishbone, or, possibly best of all, the “oyster,” that
              teaspoon of tender meat residing near each thigh. In French, it’s called “un sot-l’y-laisse”—i.e., only an
              idiot leaves it behind. Of the many strategies devised to surmount the challenges of whole-roasting a chicken,
              some now seem like fads. The practice of brining (soaking the bird overnight in a salty liquid before cooking) is based
              on an assumption that a wet bloated breast won’t dry out, and it usually doesn’t—but, being wet and bloated,
              it isn’t exactly a flavor bomb. Dry brining—a curiously contradictory concept, made popular by the late
              Judy Rodgers, of San Francisco’s Zuni Café—involves salting the chicken first, then drying it out (as
              Helen Rosner has noted, a hair dryer is a perfectly acceptable kitchen tool), so that when it goes into the
              oven (a very hot one), its fat renders immediately. The result is often delicious, but the timing is
              tricky; unless you get it exactly right, the legs will be perfect but the breast, once again, will suffer. Some
              of the most effective techniques take place on the grill, like the one said to originate in Louisiana, my
              birthplace, involving a beer can: the can—I empty mine first; hardcore aficionados leave most of the
              brew inside—goes up the bum of the bird, which is cooked, in effect, on its haunches, with the thighs
              getting the most intense heat. Another is spatchcocking, a term originating in eighteenth-century Ireland and said
              to be an abbreviation of “dispatch the cock.” In its original sense, it described cleaving the bird in
              half to make it easier to grill. Its modern meaning is captured by the French phrase en crapaudine, which means
              in the style of a toad, because a spatchcocked bird now means a flattened bird—the wings and legs
              splayed—which, viewed from above, looks remarkably like your common amphibious croaker. With all respect
              to chicken à la toad, which is a preparation of ancient provenance, a charcoal-blackened two-dimensional
              frog-like creature seems to me limited in its aesthetic appeal (it calls to mind unlucky amphibians
              crushed on hot summer asphalt) as well as in the range of its flavors, which lack the subtle surprises
              that one gets from a whole bird. The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a
              subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
              with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are
              more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as
              a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for
              cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period
              (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4]

              Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5]
              but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian
              subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
              Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the
              "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
              according to the annals of Thutmose</p>

            <h3 id="menuitem2" class="menu-title text-center">2. Beef</h3>
            <p id="text2" class="text-justify">Beef is divided into large sections called primal cuts, which you can see in our
              beef cuts chart. These primal beef cuts, or "primals," are then broken down further into subprimals, or
              "food-service cuts." These are then sliced and chopped into individual steaks, roasts, and other retail
              cuts. A side of beef is literally one side of the beef carcass that is split through the backbone. Each
              side is then halved between the 12th and 13th ribs. These sections are called the forequarter (front of the
              cow) and the hindquarter (back of the cow). The most tender cuts of beef, like the rib and tenderloin, are the
              ones farthest from the horn and hoof. The toughest areas of the animal are the shoulder and leg muscles
              because they are worked the most. Beef Chuck comes from the forequarter. Consisting of parts of the neck, shoulder blade, and upper arm, beef chuck
              produces tough but very flavorful cuts of meat. This primal cut has a good deal of connective tissue.
              That makes chuck a good choice for braised dishes like beef stew or pot roast, both of which tenderize tough cuts. Due to its fat content, beef chuck is also
              excellent for making ground beef that produces juicy burgers and ground beef stew. The classic 7-bone
              roast comes from the beef chuck, as do the increasingly popular flat iron steak and
              Denver steak. With conventional butchering, the beef chuck is separated from the rib primal between the
              fifth and sixth ribs. This means that it also contains a few inches of the longissimus dorsi muscle, which is the same
              tender muscle that rib-eye steaks are made from.Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle,
              particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source of
              protein and nutrients.[2]

              Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts,
              short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak,
              etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are
              usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in
              sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include
              other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands
              (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although
              forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad
              cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries,
              prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but are more
              often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from
              younger cows (calves) is called veal.

              Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for
              breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince
              (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on
              grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot
              (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein,
              roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.

              Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production
              worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[5] In absolute numbers, the United States,
              Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay,
              however, has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According
              to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing
              the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In comparison, the average American consumed
              only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year, while African countries, such as Mozambique,
              Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.

              In 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China produced the most beef with 12.22 million tons, 9.9 million
              tons, and 6.46 million tons respectively.[6] The top 3 beef exporting countries in 2019 were Australia
              (14.8% of total exports), the United States (13.4% of total exports), and Brazil (12.6% of total
              exports).[7] Beef production is also important to the economies of Japan, Argentina, Uruguay, Canada,
              Paraguay, Mexico, Belarus and Nicaragua.

              Beef production has a high environmental impact per gram of protein. </p>
